# Transient Trouble

## Contract Background
`ExclusiveClub` is a smart contract that represents joining a very exclusive club. To become a member you must pay some ether and in return you receive an NFT representing your ticket to the club.

When running test cases use the following command line input: `forge test --isolate --mt test_GetThisPassing_8` 

## Goal
You have 0.1 ether, can you get at least 3 tickets?
